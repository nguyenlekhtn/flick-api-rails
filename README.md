# Flickr API Rails

A web app that displays Flickr photos of a users fetched via Flickr API. Client needs to input the User ID of the user they want to show his/ her photos.  
In this project, I used [flickr gem](https://github.com/cyclotron3k/flickr) as a library to access Flickr API in a simple way. This project is also the first time I use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style my web app.
